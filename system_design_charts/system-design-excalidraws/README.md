A collection of notes/diagrams I made in Excalidraw while studying for System Design Interviews

Original Sources where I studied the material.

HI - [Hello Interview mock interview platform notes](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)

As for the nice/well-designed components that you see I got a lot of them from Fabian Hinsenkamp [here](https://bigtechcoach.gumroad.com/l/excalidraw-system-design-symbols), so big thanks to him!
